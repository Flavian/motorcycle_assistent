I created this project to equipe my BMW F650 GS motorcycle with a digital chain oiler.
To control it I added a display and some other chips.
This project is still in the alpha phase.

## Hardware:
+ Arduino nano/uno   (Uno for development, Nano for actual use in my motorcycle)
+ SSD1306 display
+ DS18B20 temperature sensor
+ DS3231 clock chip
+ 2 * 4,7k, 2 * 12k Ohm Resistor
+ Button
+ Wiring

## Features:
+ Trigger the chain oiler pump after a given periode of time
+ Display temperature
+ Display battery voltage
+ Display date and time (dim display accourding to the time)
+ Provide a menu for the settings
